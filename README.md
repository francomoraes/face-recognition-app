## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) - A.I. library
- [Particles-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js) - Styles library
- [React-tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tilt) - Styles library
- [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) - CSS Tollkit - Open source component library

### What I learned x Continued Development

The projetct was perfect to learn that there are tremendous amounts of code already set and ready for us to catch, customize and use in our own projects. The Tachyons library, for example, makes it very fast and simple to implement styles in any project; the tilt and particles libraries really make an impression with very little effort; and the Clarifai API that gives us the opportunity to play with A.I. and add it to our projects. Reallt fantastic.

Next steps:
- Add login/register features
- Add backend connections
- Add recognition to more than one face at the same image

### Useful resources
